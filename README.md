# Prediction-of-real-estate-prices-in-the-city-of-Milan
During this project, I've analysed the rent prices of several houses in the city of Milan in order to fit the more accurate model in terms of prediction. 
The initial part of the project was truly challenging because it was crucial to understand the most important featurea and to deal with a huge amount of missing data. Sometimes regression model were used to address them and sometimes it was just a logical trick. 
Several models were used, from linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression to random forest, neural network and svm. 
In the end the most efficent tool was a linear regression with a subsample of the covariates and several transformation of covariates.
